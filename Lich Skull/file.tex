A skull of a powerful magic user. It is sentient and calls himself "Qrec'zig". Upon asking for help \textbf{roll+CHA}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item on 10+: the being helps you. No strings attached.
	\item on 7-9: the being helps, but you must answer one of these questions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What is your biggest fear?
			\item What is you most desire?
			\item What is the your weakness?
		\end{itemize}
	\item on 6-: the skull helps but not in a way you would like. This also might come at a price you did not expect
\end{itemize}
